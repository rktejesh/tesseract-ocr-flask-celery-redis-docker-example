### Build & Launch

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Enable hot code reload

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.development.yml up --build
```

This will expose the Flask application's endpoints on port `5001`, Streamlit application on port `8051` as well as a [Flower](https://github.com/mher/flower) server for monitoring workers on port `5555`

We can also scale easily to add more workers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --scale worker=5 --no-recreate
```

To shut down:

```bash
docker-compose down
```


To change the endpoints, update the code in [api/app.py](api/app.py)

Task changes should happen in [celery-queue/tasks.py](celery-queue/tasks.py)
